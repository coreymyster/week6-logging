This is a simple application that checks whether a user accurately logs in with a valid username and password. The getUser() function takes two parameters; the username and the password. 

getUser("Corey", "password") will return a successful log.

If the username passed in is changed to something else, a warning will be logged. If anything else is passed in, then an error will be logged.
